# Tank-Transfer-Program
A real world program that aids in the transfer of physical inventory of product. Would mainly be used by a terminal operator. Coded in Python.

You must download all three files and have them in the same folder in order for this program to run. If program does not run properly, try running it without debugging. I use ANSI colors in this program, so be aware that if the output looks weird you might need to install a package that will allow the shell or terminal to show colors.

I hope you enjoy the program and leave a comment if you have suggestions for improvemnts or like a certain feature in this program.
